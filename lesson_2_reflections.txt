What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it takes a snapshot of the existing files in
your location. You need to do it so you can begin to commit new versions of the
files in your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally can be help-
ful when making changes offline. After you make changes, you can run git diff to
see the changes from the master on remote.
